Bandwidth: range of frequencies that can be transmitted through a medium (wire fiber radio)

Range: highest frequency - lowest frequency

Hertz: changes/sec (changes per second; range of frequencies)

Shannon's theorem relates the data rate to the bandwidth B) and signal strength (S) relative to the noise (N):
 Max. data rate = B log(subscript 2)(1+S/N) bits/sec
 S/N = signal to noise ratio
 
 
 B = 4000Hz
 S/N = 512
 
 Max Data Rate = 400log(base 2)(1+512)
 4000log2(513) = 4000*9 = 36000 bps
 
 We desire a maz data rate of 100 Mbps through a medium that supports a bandwidth of 4 GHz. What signal to noise ratio is needed?
 
 100,000,000 bps = 400,000,000,000 log2(1+S/N)
 
 DIvide both sides by 4Billion
 
 1/40 = log2(1+S/N)
 2^1/40 = 1+S/N
 
 2^1/40 - 1 = S/N
 .0175 = S/N
